# Repositories where direct master/main commits are allowed
#
# Both pre-commit and pre-push hooks source this file for consistency.
# Patterns are matched against the full remote URL using substring matching.
#
# Examples:
#   "bob"         - matches any repo containing "bob" (e.g., github.com/user/bob)
#   "ErikBjare/bob" - matches specific owner/repo
#   "github.com/user/my-agent" - matches full URL pattern
#
# Agent workspaces with gptme.toml [agent] section are automatically allowed.
# Template repositories used as the basis for agent workspaces are also auto-allowed.
#
ALLOWED_PATTERNS=(
    # Add your agent workspaces here, e.g.:
    # "bob"
    # "alice"
    # "ErikBjare/my-agent"
)
