# Overview
This project uses TypeScript with React best practices. All code should follow strict type safety and modern React patterns.

## Rules

### Always
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Use hooks for state management
- Include proper error handling

### Auto Attached: tsx!
- Always define prop types with interfaces
- Use React.FC for functional components
- Destructure props at function signature

### Auto Attached: test!
- Write tests for all components
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Aim for 80%+ coverage

## Deprecated
- Class components (use functional components instead)
- PropTypes (use TypeScript interfaces instead)
- any types (use proper typing)
