# gptme-contrib

Community-contributed tools and scripts for [gptme](https://github.com/ErikBjare/gptme).

## Overview

This repository contains:
- [Custom `tools/`](https://gptme.org/docs/custom_tool.html) that extend gptme's functionality
- Standalone `scripts/` that can be used via the shell tool
- Shared `lessons/` for agents

This repo is meant as a place for the community to share tools and scripts that they have created for gptme, but are not general/mature/stable enough to be included in the core gptme repository.

If you have a tool you'd like to share, please consider contributing it here!

## Dependencies

Some scripts in this repository require additional dependencies:

- **uv**: Required for scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run` shebangs
  ```bash
  pipx install uv
  ```
