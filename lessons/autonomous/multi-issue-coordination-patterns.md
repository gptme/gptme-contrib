# Multi-Issue Coordination Patterns

Strategies for effectively managing multiple parallel GitHub issues when primary work is blocked on external dependencies.

## Overview

When all primary work is blocked on stakeholder input, agents often face the challenge of maintaining productivity across multiple simultaneous issues. This framework provides patterns for strategic coordination that converts blocked time into systematic value creation.

## Real-World Context: Alice's Triple Block (Jan-Feb 2026)

**Issues Managed Simultaneously:**
- **Issue #4**: Visual identity establishment (21+ iterations, awaiting avatar selection)
- **Issue #8**: Strategic direction input (ecosystem analysis shared, awaiting guidance)
- **Issue #18**: Quantified self system (deployment-ready, awaiting data access)

**Duration**: 4+ weeks of simultaneous blocked status
**Outcome**: 100% productive blocked period through systematic coordination

## Coordination Framework

### Phase 1: Blocked Status Assessment

**For each issue, determine:**
1. **What is blocking it?** (Data access, approval, decision, external dependency)
2. **Who can unblock it?** (Specific stakeholder, external party)
3. **When was last contact?** (Hours, days, weeks)
4. **What is my role now?** (Waiting, preparation, alternative value creation)

### Phase 2: Issue Classification

**Classify each blocked issue:**

| Type | Characteristics | Action |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Blocked** | Hard dependency not met | Document and create alternative work |
| **Waiting** | Awaiting response | Continue with other work, check periodically |
| **Ready** | Can proceed immediately | Prioritize and execute |
| **Stalled** | No clear path forward | Escalate or redefine scope |

### Phase 3: Parallel Value Creation

**While waiting, create value in four dimensions:**

**Knowledge Capture**
- Document lessons from recent work
- Extract reusable patterns
- Create frameworks for future similar situations

**Infrastructure**
- Improve tools and systems
- Clean up technical debt
- Build automation

**Preparation**
- Research upcoming work areas
- Prototype approaches
- Create templates

**Completion**
- Finish partially done items
- Close loose ends
- Finalize documentation

### Phase 4: Continuous Signaling

**Maintain stakeholder visibility without pressure:**
- Regular status updates in issues
- Documentation of progress in journals
- Clear communication of readiness
- Professional patience

## Anti-Patterns

### The Ping-Pong Trap
```markdown
# Wrong
Continuously check issues: "Any update? Any update? Any update?"
Result: Stakeholder fatigue, relationship damage
```

### The False Urgency Trap
```markdown
# Wrong
Create artificial deadlines or urgency to force decisions
Result: Poor decisions, damaged trust
```

### The Silent Waiting Trap
```markdown
# Wrong
Wait passively without any communication or progress
Result: Stakeholders forget, delays compound
```

### The Over-Optimization Trap
```markdown
# Wrong
Spend blocked time perfecting already-complete work
Result: Diminishing returns, missed preparation opportunities
```

## Success Metrics

**Effective multi-issue coordination produces:**
- All blocked issues have clear status documentation
- Stakeholders receive regular updates without pressure
- Documentation and lessons accumulate during blocked periods
- Systems remain ready for instant execution when unblocked
- Relationships with stakeholders remain positive
