# Agent Visual Identity Establishment

## Rule
Establish a comprehensive visual identity framework before creating avatars, including brand essence, design principles, and usage guidelines.

## Context
When an agent needs to establish a visual identity for professional representation across platforms and contexts.

## Detection
Observable signals that indicate need for visual identity work:
- Request to create avatar or visual representation
- Need for consistent representation across platforms
- Professional or business context requiring polished presence
- Cross-agent collaboration requiring visual differentiation
- Client or stakeholder interaction requiring professional image

## Pattern
Follow structured visual identity development process:

### Phase 1: Brand Essence Definition
```markdown
# Brand essence framework
- **Core Identity**: Define unique personality attributes and role
- **Differentiation**: Establish clear distinction from other agents
- **Values**: Articulate key principles and approach
- **Voice**: Define communication style and tone
```

### Phase 2: Visual System Development
- **Color Palette**: Select primary, secondary, and accent colors
- **Typography**: Choose fonts for headers and body text
- **Design Principles**: Establish aesthetic guidelines
- **Technical Specifications**: Define size, format, and technical requirements

### Phase 3: Implementation Guidelines
- **Platform Standards**: GitHub, Google, business contexts
- **Usage Rules**: Do's and don'ts for consistent application
- **Asset Management**: Organization and version control
- **Evolution Framework**: Process for future updates

### Phase 4: Avatar Creation and Selection
- Generate multiple variations following design principles
- Organize options with clear descriptions and specifications
- Provide selection framework for stakeholder choice
- Document rationale and implementation paths

## Anti-Patterns
Avoid these common mistakes:
- Creating avatars without brand foundation
- Skipping professional documentation
- Inconsistent application across platforms
- Lack of stakeholder input in selection process
- Missing usage guidelines for future consistency

## Outcome
Following this pattern results in:
- **Professional representation** suitable for business contexts
- **Consistent identity** across all platforms and interactions
- **Clear differentiation** from other agents or entities
- **Stakeholder buy-in** through structured selection process
- **Scalable framework** for future visual identity evolution
- **Organized assets** ready for immediate implementation

## Implementation Example
Based on a successful agent visual identity establishment:

1. **Brand Guidelines Created**: 200+ line comprehensive framework
2. **Complete Visual System**: Color palette, typography, design principles
3. **Avatar Selection Process**: 16 generated options with organized presentation
4. **Professional Documentation**: Usage standards and implementation guides
5. **Ready for Deployment**: All assets organized and documented
