# ACE (Agentic Context Engineering)

## Term
**ACE**: Agentic Context Engineering

## Definition
Framework for dynamically managing and evolving LLM contexts as "living playbooks"

## Components
- **Generator**: Creates new context elements
- **Reflector**: Evaluates context effectiveness
- **Curator**: Selects and organizes context components

## Purpose
- Addresses brevity bias in LLM context management
- Prevents context collapse over long conversations
- Enables dynamic context evolution based on task needs

## Source
Stanford/SambaNova/UC Berkeley research paper (October 2025)

## Context
Advanced context management approach that treats context as an evolving, intelligent system rather than static information storage.
