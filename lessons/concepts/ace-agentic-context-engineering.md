# ACE (Agentic Context Engineering)

## Term
**ACE**: Agentic Context Engineering

## Definition
Framework for dynamically managing and evolving LLM contexts as "living playbooks" that adapt over time.

## Components
- **Generator**: Creates new context elements based on task needs
- **Reflector**: Evaluates context effectiveness and identifies gaps
- **Curator**: Selects, organizes, and prunes context components

## Purpose
- Addresses brevity bias in LLM context management
- Prevents context collapse over long conversations
- Enables dynamic context evolution based on task needs

## Applicability

Use ACE concepts when:
- Managing long-running agent sessions
- Building systems that need to evolve context over time
- Addressing context staleness or collapse issues

Stanford/SambaNova/UC Berkeley research paper (October 2025)
